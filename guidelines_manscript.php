				<h3>Manscript Submission Guidelines</h3>
				<hr>
				<h5>Submission Guidelines to authors:</h5>
				<p>Original and revised manuscripts can be submitted via online or can be mailed to XXXXXXX</p>
				<h5>ROLE OF AUTHORS</h5>
				<p align="justify">Authors of original research (not previously published or under consideration for publication
				elsewhere) should ensure about accurate presentation of the work carried out, a discussion of the
				significance of the work in context with previous works, and should contain sufficient experimental detail
				to allow others to replicate the work. Appropriate citation of previously published works must always be
				included. Authors should disclose any financial or other conflicts of interest that may be construed as
				influencing the data or interpretation. All sources of financial support should be disclosed. Authorship
				should be limited to those persons who have made a significant contribution to the work in terms of
				conception, design, experimental implementation, and data analysis and interpretation. All persons
				making significant contributions should be included as co-authors. If an author discovers a significant
				error in the published work, the author is obligated to inform the journal editor in order to either correct or
				retract the paper.</p>

				<h5>DOUBLE-BLIND PEER REVIEW PROCESS</h5>
				<p align="justify">Both the reviewer and the author are anonymous in this model. Author anonymity limits reviewer
				bias, for example based on an author&#39;s gender, country of origin, academic status or previous publication
				history. Articles written by prestigious or renowned authors are considered based on the content of their
				papers, rather than their reputation.</p>
				<p align="justify">Reviewers&#39; comments to the editors are confidential and before passing on to the author will be
				made anonymous. Based on the reviewers&#39; comments, the Editorial Board will make a final decision on
				the acceptability of the manuscript, and communicate to the authors the decision, along with referees&#39;
				reports. Whether significant revisions are proposed, acceptance is dependent on whether the author can
				deal with those satisfactorily.</p>

				<h5>PUBLICATION POLICY</h5>
				<p align="justify">The journal employs the double-blind peer review process, where both reviewers and
				authors remain anonymous throughout the review process.</p>
				<p align="justify">Every Manuscript submitted for publication reviewed by the editor. If the paper complies with the editorial policies and with a minimum quality level, then it is sent to two reviewers
				(Double-blind peer review).</p>

				<h5>ROLE OF THE PUBLISHER</h5>
				<p align="justify">In cases of proven scientific misconduct, plagiarism, or fraudulent publication, the publisher, in
				collaboration with the editorial board, will take appropriate action to clarify the situation, publish an
				erratum, or retract the work in question.</p>

				<h5>PUBLICATION FREQUENCY</h5>
				<p align="justify">Journal frequency is half yearly and publish 2 issues in a year.<br>

				The Last date for submission of manuscripts is 1 st week of March for January- June issue and
				1 st week of October for July- December issue every year.</p>

				<h5>PUBLICATION YEAR</h5>
				<p align="justify">1 <sup>st</sup> issue will be started from July 2020.</p>
